# Real_Article_Classification
This project explores two machine learning models for article classification (fake/real): a deep learning model and a classical machine learning approach using a random forest classifier.
#### This task is based on a Kaggle competition and its provided dataset, which aims to determine which text in each pair is considered real.

Dataset used: [Fake or Real: The Impostor Hunt in Texts](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-or-real-the-impostor-hunt/overview)
